## ⚡ Quick Reference

### Services to Deploy (11 total)

**Databases (Add these first):**
- PostgreSQL × 4
- Redis × 1

**Applications (Set root directory!):**
- `services/user-service`
- `services/project-service`
- `services/task-service`
- `services/notification-service`
- `services/api-gateway` ⭐
- `frontend` ⭐

⭐ = Generate public domain

---

## 🎯 Critical Setting

**For EACH application service:**

```
Railway → Select Service → Settings → Root Directory
```

Set to the correct path:
- User Service: `services/user-service`
- Project Service: `services/project-service`
- Task Service: `services/task-service`
- Notification Service: `services/notification-service`
- API Gateway: `services/api-gateway`
- Frontend: `frontend`

**⚠️ Without this, you'll get the loader error!**

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

After deployment:

- [ ] All 11 services show "Active" (green)
- [ ] API Gateway has public domain
- [ ] Frontend has public domain
- [ ] Can access frontend URL in browser
- [ ] See Myceili green login page

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

1. Check service logs in Railway dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Confirm root directories are correct
4. Read the troubleshooting section in `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`

---

## 💡 Tips

- Deploy databases before applications
- Deploy backend services before API gateway
- Generate domains for API Gateway and Frontend
- Update environment variables with real URLs
- Redeploy after changing environment variables

## ⏱️ Estimated Time
